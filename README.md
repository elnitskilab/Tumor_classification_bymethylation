# Tumor_classification_bymethylation
classification of TCGA tumors by three methylation probes

How to read the “ANALYSIS_OF_TCGA_DATA_EXAMPLE_FILE.csv” file generated by running the “Tumor classification_TCGA data.R” code:

The ‘results’ data.frame contain 7x3 rows: one for each combination of markers (single, pairwise, or triple) for the three TCGA cancer types included in the training dataset (BLCA, BRCA, COAD). 

The column ‘threshold’ specifies the probability threshold from logistic regression analysis that results in maximum sensitivity + specificity (Youden’s index) in the training dataset. The following columns (‘sensitivity’ - ‘auc’) show the performance of the marker combinations in classifying tumor from normal tissue in the training dataset. 

The last 6 columns show the results when using the regression coefficients, threshold, and probe combination from each row to predict probabilities in the validation cohort. PLEASE NOTE, that in this test dataset the validation cohort derives only from breast cancer/normal tissue. Thus, the relevant read-out for assay performance in the independent breast tissue validation cohort can be found in row 8-14, column 20-25.
